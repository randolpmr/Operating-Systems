OPERATING SYSTEMS FUNCTIONS:  

The operating system communicates between the various instructions given by the user 
so that they are on par with each other. The operating system manages input and output 
by running the program that creates the output from user input. Managing input and 
output is achieved by coordinating and assigning functions of the input and output 
devices when running one or more applications. 

Scheduling of resources and jobs: The operating system prepares the list of tasks to be 
performed for each computer system device. The operating system decides which device to 
use for which task. The order that these tasks are completed by the scheduling progeams 
and based on the priority of the device assigned by the user.
