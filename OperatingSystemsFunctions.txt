
OPERATING SYSTEMS FUNCTIONS:  

The operating system communicates between the various instructions given by the user 
so that they are on par with each other. The operating system manages input and output 
by running the program that creates the output from user input. Managing input and output 
is achieved by coordinating and assigning functions of the input and output devices when 
running one or more applications.
